Stack builds down from end of RAM (E800)

E000-E6FF is cleared at startup. Stack is probably reserved from E700-E800. That's huge.
I captured RAM access for a typical run through MAME and found the stack builds down
to E7E0. It has a long way to go still!

There are 32 objects that are processed with each ISR interrupt. All 32 are processed
every ISR. Each object is a 16 byte structure. The first byte selects the code to run
for the object when the ISR fires. This value is an offset in a jump table with 1 being 
the first entry. A value of 0 means do nothing (the object is inactive or available).

Unlike the "text" objects processed in the main-loop, these objects are fixed. Object 0
is always the moon-buggy. Object 2 is always the player's forward shot. Objects 3..6
are always the four player-air-shots.

E600..E6FF contains a list of ??text??game commands to execute.
E1CF contains the LSB of the first command.
E1D0 contains the LSB of the next-available command.
The loop at 0283 starts with the pointer E1CF and runs commands until
it reaches E1D0 (the list wraps back around as the LSB wraps). 

The code at 02C2 adds new commands to the list. There is no checking to
see if the list overflows.

The code at 029C advances the list's "head" over an inactive command. All
commands eventually become inactive thus they eventually all get removed
from the front of the list.

The format of these commands:
```
  00 Command number (00=none)
  01 ?? ISR value for next execution (@0325) --
  02 Text script LSB
  03 Text script MSB
```
